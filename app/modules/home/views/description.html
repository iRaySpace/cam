<p>Nicely done! You were able to get through the setting up part. Feel free to customize the grunt file or add new 
    dependencies in package.json and/or bower.json
</p>
<p> Now, what you are seeing in your screen is a combination of CodeIgniter, Angular.js and MongoDB. 
    This is not the best template there is but you can start from here. Feel free to tinker around
    or you can look up some other web frameworks that suites you better.</p>
